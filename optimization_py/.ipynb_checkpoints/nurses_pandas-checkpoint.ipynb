    "Some shifts overlap in time, and thus cannot be assigned to the same nurse.\n",
    "To check whether two shifts overlap in time, we start by ordering all shifts with respect to their *wstart* and *duration* properties. Then, for each shift, we iterate over the subsequent shifts in this ordered list to easily compute the subset of overlapping shifts.\n",
